# Creality K1
 This is where I will have the files I have and use with my Creality K1 Printer.
 
 As I work with it and use things I will add them here.  Right now I have been working on a SuperSlicer Profile for it as well as trying to get it deneutered so you can use the full blown Klipper with the default Fluidd that is install and been stripped down or Mainsail.  I will be adding things as I get them working.

 20230630 - Added Slicer Profiles for SuperSlicer and Prusa Slicer and also added a folder with the original configs off the K1.
